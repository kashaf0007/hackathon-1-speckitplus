**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../../spec.md)
**Tasks File**: [Link to tasks.md](../tasks.md)

## Task Content Quality

- [X] Tasks are clear, concise, and unambiguous.
- [X] Tasks are granular enough to be individually completable within a short timeframe.
- [X] Each task includes relevant file paths.
- [X] Tasks are organized by user story for independent implementation.
- [X] Foundational tasks are clearly identified as blockers.
- [X] No implementation details are missing for core functionalities.

## Task Completeness
