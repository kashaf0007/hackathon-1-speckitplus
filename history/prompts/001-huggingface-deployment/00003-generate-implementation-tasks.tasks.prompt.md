## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the implementation tasks for the Hugging Face Deployment feature. The tasks are organized by phase and user story in the `tasks.md` file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed set of implementation tasks for the Hugging Face Deployment feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were generated as per the user's request.
- 📁 Files:
    - `specs/001-huggingface-deployment/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The generated tasks provide a clear roadmap for implementing the feature. The next step is to start implementing the tasks.
